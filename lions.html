                <h3>LIONS</h3>
                <p>The lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>) is one of the five big cats in the genus <em>Panthera</em> and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion refers to several subspecies found in Africa. Some males can weigh over 250 kg (550 lb), making it the second-largest living cat after the tiger.</p>
                <p>Wild lions currently inhabit sub-Saharan Africa and a small population persists in Indiaâ€™s Gir Forest National Park. Historically, lions had a much wider range, spanning Africa, Europe, and the Americas. They were once the most widespread large land mammals after humans.</p>
                <p>Today, lions are a vulnerable species, with major population declines due to habitat loss and conflict with humans. The West African lion population is especially endangered. Lions primarily live in designated reserves and national parks.</p>
                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                <p>You will find the lions at the Northern Frontier.</p>
