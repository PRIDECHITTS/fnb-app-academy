                <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                <p>The giant panda (<em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear native to south central China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda.</p>
                <p>Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. In the wild, it occasionally eats other grasses, wild tubers, or even small animals and carrion. In captivity, its diet may include honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, and fruits, along with specially prepared food.</p>
                <p>Giant pandas live in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu. Due to farming, deforestation, and other development, pandas have been driven out of the lowland areas they once inhabited. The giant panda is a conservation-reliant endangered species.</p>
