                <h3>KOALAS</h3>
                <p>The koala (<em>Phascolarctos cinereus</em>, or, inaccurately, koala bear) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.</p>
                <p>It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. Koalas have a body length of 60 to 85 cm (24 to 33 in) and weigh 4 to 15 kg (9 to 33 lb). Pelage colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south.</p>
                <p>Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows and mark territory with secretions from chest scent glands. Koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothersâ€™ pouches for development.</p>
                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                <p>You will find the koalas next to the giraffe enclosure.</p>
