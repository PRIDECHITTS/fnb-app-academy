                <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                <p>Giraffes are the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest ruminants. Their distinguishing characteristics are their extremely long neck and legs, horn-like ossicones, and distinctive coat patterns. They primarily eat leaves from tall trees, especially acacias.</p>
                <p>They are native to Africa and typically found in savannahs and open woodlands.</p>
                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                <p>You will find the giraffes at pen G14, near the central observation tower.</p>
